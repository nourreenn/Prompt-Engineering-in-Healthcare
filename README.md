## Key Components
1. **Documentation**
   - `docs/Prompt_Engineering_for_Disease_Diagnosis.pdf`: Contains detailed information about prompt engineering techniques and their application in healthcare diagnosis

2. **Core Implementation**
   - `src/api/app.py`: Main application entry point and API endpoints
   - `src/core/prompt_engineering.py`: Core implementation of prompt engineering techniques
   - `src/data/data_loader.py`: Handles data loading, preprocessing, and management
   - `src/utils/check_data.py`: Utilities for data validation and quality checks
   - `src/models/download_model.py`: Tools for downloading and managing AI models
   - `src/visualization/visualization.py`: Tools for data visualization and analysis

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Review the documentation in the PDF file
3. Install required dependencies
4. Run `src/models/download_model.py` to get the necessary AI models
5. Use `src/utils/check_data.py` to validate your input data
6. Run the application using `src/api/app.py`

## Purpose
This project aims to:
- Improve disease diagnosis accuracy through effective prompt engineering
- Provide healthcare professionals with better tools for patient assessment
- Enhance the efficiency of medical diagnosis processes
- Enable data-driven visualization and analysis of medical data
- Facilitate easy model management and deployment

## Future Development
The project structure will be expanded to include:
- Additional test cases in the `tests/` directory
- More example prompts
- Enhanced evaluation metrics
- Documentation for different disease categories
- Integration with additional healthcare systems
- Performance optimization tools
